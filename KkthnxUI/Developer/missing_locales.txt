TOTAL MISSING STRINGS: ~200+ strings

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add all missing strings to enUS.lua first
2. Create translation templates for other languages
3. Prioritize most commonly used settings
4. Consider using translation services for major languages
5. Add tooltips for complex settings
6. Group related settings together in locale files
